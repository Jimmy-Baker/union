###  Description  ####
Union Climbing is a Web Application created for my Internet Technologies Project course (WEB-289) at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College. The projects consists of a website and integrated database, and was written in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

Union is a framework for allowing collaboration and access sharing between climbing gyms. The design of the current software used by 90% of climbing gyms precludes the ability to share user information. Climbers, as frequent travelers by nature, have historically been dissuaded from purchasing memberships when their access would  hindered by an inability to stay in the same place. Union solves both of these issues with a centralized database for sharing user information and a structure for distributing and redeeming access passes.
